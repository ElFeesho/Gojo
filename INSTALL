 -(@)- Gojo Install Doc -(@)-

Gojo itself is only one file when compiled and ready to run. You 
need: 
	SDL, 
	SDL_image,  
	SDL_mixer,(Optional, for mixing sound streams)
	SDL_gfx, (Optional, for graphic manipulation)
	SDL_ttf, (Optional, for true type fonts)
	SDL_net (Optional, for tcp/udp networking)
	and Lua.
	
They each have their own dependencies but I leave that 
up to you or your package manager to sort out.

Once you have all your dependencies met, simply run the make 
command to compile the gojo binary. To disable optional libraries,
alter the 'src/config.h' file, and remove "#define SDL_LIBNAME" to
remove the library's functionality.

If you want to install gojo on your system, simply copy the 
binary gojo to a directory within your PATH. For now, there are
no man pages or info docs to install. 

Static binary versions (thus requiring no dependency resolution) 
of gojo may be made available at a later time for x86, 64bit 
x86, and ARM.

For game developers, you probably will want to include a binary 
copy of gojo with your game distribution. Dynamically linked, 
the binary is less than 200k. Statically link and stripped it's 
only a few megs. Your audio data is likely to be larger than 
this.

I appologize for the shoddy nature of this INSTALL doc. I will 
write a better one when I get more time. I saw there was a need 
of one and figured a shoddy one is better than none at all.
